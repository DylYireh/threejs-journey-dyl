# Three.js Journey – Dylan's Repo

This is my personalized Three.js Journey repo, powered by a custom `threejs-yireh-starter` setup.

## Structure

- `threejs-yireh-starter/` – My custom boilerplate starter (Prettier + Cursor ready)
- `Chapter-2/` – Each lesson folder goes here

## Setup

1. Copy the `threejs-yireh-starter/` folder for each new lesson
2. Replace `script.js`, assets, etc. with lesson files
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Push changes to track progress

Blessed grind, clean code 🙏
